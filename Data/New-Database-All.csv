This has impacted on her ability to practice as a nurse.  as been cleared by the Department of Human Services as well as the Board of Nursing.  The barrier is that there is a charge of child abuse related to partner's 10 year old son.

The legal difficulty began in December 2010 in what client describes as isolated incident in which she and her partner were involved in an argument.  Apparently client pointed a knife during the argument.  She says her intent was not to harm him but that he was about to leave the situation and it was her wish to emphasize that she felt it important that they discuss the matter.  Denies anything like this has happened before or since.  A charge of domestic assault with a weopon was made. In the process of investigating this the police spoke with her partner's son.  The son made an allegation that she had abused him that day.  She acknowledged, when interviewed by the police, that she had spanked him that day.  A child abuse charge resulted from this.  Eventually a plea bargain was struck in which the domestic violence charge was dropped and she pled guilty to the child abuse charge.  It is the latter of these charges that is impacting her ability to obtain gainful employment.  She is trying to cooperate with the process so she can return to work and her partner and her can be reunified with the son. There is a no contact order in place for her partner's son.

He was confronted early July 2011 by church leadership that he was to cease any further contact with the young female as well as all involvement at church apart from attending worship.  

Client was looking for validation of the painful experiences related to this experience.
